Fake news encapsulates bits of news that may be hoaxes, and is typically disseminated via social media and online. It is often accomplished in order to perpetuate or implement those ideas, and is often achieved by political agendas. These news reports may contain false and/or misleading statements, 
which may result in algorithms viralizing them, and users may end up in a filter bubble.
